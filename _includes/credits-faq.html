      <li>
          <b>What is this program?</b>
          <br />
          Microsoft is offering grants of Azure credits to select open source projects to help with their short-term development, infrastructure, and testing needs. Workloads such as long-term website hosting, continuous integration, and permanent database hosting are not a good fit for this program. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>How long do the grants last?</b>
        <br />
        Each grant will be given through May 31st of the calendar year. Please note that in April decisions regarding your project's acceptance to the program may take longer as we reevaluate our program requirements. 
      </li>
        <li>
        <b>What open source projects are eligible to apply?</b>
        <br />
        Any open source project with an <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/category">OSI-approved license </a> and a formalized Code of Conduct is eligible to apply. Be aware that the program is highly popular, and acceptance into the program is competitive and limited. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>How do I apply?</b><br />
            Fill out and submit the application form on the Apply tab. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>If granted credits, what is required?</b><br />
        Projects will need to have or setup some kind of Microsoft account (Outlook.com mail, or have a Microsoft 365 account) to 
        connect the subscription to. Azure requires a credit card to connect to a subscription as well. Notice is provided before 
        credits expire if you need to spin down resources or cancel the subscription to avoid charge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>When will I be notified of the decision on my application?</b>
        <br />
        We review all applications and notify all applicants of our decisions within 3-4 weeks.
